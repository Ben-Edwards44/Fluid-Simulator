To do:
- [X] optimise particle lookups for density calculations
- [X] viscosity
- [ ] optimise spatial lookup and start indices calculations to run on gpu
- [X] near density and near pressure
- [ ] increase number of particles
- [X] add slider for near pressure multiplier
- [X] add labels for sliders
- [ ] improve performance
